## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the location feature in the dating app, which allows users to specify their city during registration and view location information in the dating zone.

  - Hyderabad
  - Chennai
  - Chandigarh
  - Ahmedabad
  - Indore
  - Jaipur
  - Lucknow
  - Goa

### 2. Database Schema Updates

- Created migration script (`server/src/migration.sql`) for existing databases

### 3. Backend API Updates
- Updated `/api/register` endpoint to handle location data
- Updated `/api/me` endpoint to return location information
- Updated `/api/feed` endpoint to include location in profile data

## Implementation Details

### Registration Form Component
- Created `LocationSelect` component that shows dropdown for predefined cities
- When "Others" is selected, shows an additional text input for custom city
- Validates that custom city is provided when "Others" is selected

### Database Changes
```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS location TEXT;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS custom_location TEXT;
```

### API Changes
- Registration endpoint now accepts `location` and `customLocation` fields
- All profile-related endpoints now return location information
- Location validation ensures custom city is provided when "Others" is selected

### UI/UX Improvements
- Location is displayed with a üìç emoji for better visual identification
- Location appears in profile headers alongside gender and relationship status
- Location is shown in all relevant sections (dating zone, matches, chat, requests)
- Responsive design maintains layout integrity with location information

## Usage

### For New Users
1. During registration, select a city from the dropdown
2. If your city is not listed, select "Others" and enter your city name
3. Location will be displayed in your profile and visible to other users

### For Existing Users
- Existing users will need to update their profile to add location information
- Location fields will be null/empty for existing users until updated

## Migration
To add location support to an existing database, run:
```sql
-- Run the migration script
\i server/src/migration.sql
```

## Testing
1. Start the server: `cd server && npm run dev`
2. Start the client: `cd client && npm run dev`
3. Register a new user and test location selection
4. Verify location appears in dating zone and other sections
5. Test "Others" option with custom city input

## Future Enhancements
- Location-based filtering in dating zone
- Distance calculation between users
- Location-based matching algorithms
- City-specific features or promotions
